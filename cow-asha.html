        <p>Asha was found injured after being a victim of a road. She was brought to HEADS & TAILS with several broken bones! She was brought to us in a terrible state as a tiny baby calf in June 2020. Our vets ensured she received the appropriate care & love whereas the other bovine residents gave her company. Asha is now fully recovered and is a permanent resident at HEADS & TAILS. You can passively adopt her to give her a secure, stable life filled with love & care.</p>

        <p>Through passive adoption, you can sponsor the meals & basic needs of the animal on a monthly basis without taking them home. We look after them, provide medical care & grooming while they continue to live at our centre. Your sponsorship enables us to focus our resources on maintaining & upgrading our infrastructure & veterinary care facilities. You can visit your adoptee as often as youâ€™d like & ensure they live the rest of their days with security, stability & love.</p>
