        <p>During the peak of Covid lock down in 2020, Beyonce was seen wandering around all alone on the streets. An animal lover observed that she was being followed by a person with ill intentions. The animal lover quickly led her to safety, called Heads N Tails for help and she was brought to our Large Animal Rescue Centre. She is not a permanent resident at our shelter.</p>

        <p>Through passive adoption, you can sponsor the meals & basic needs of the animal on a monthly basis without taking them home. We look after them, provide medical care & grooming while they continue to live at our centre. Your sponsorship enables us to focus our resources on maintaining & upgrading our infrastructure & veterinary care facilities. You can visit your adoptee as often as youâ€™d like & ensure they live the rest of their days with security, stability & love.</p>
