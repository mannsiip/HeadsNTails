        <p>Maggie was treated at TC and brought to Heads N Tails in Jan 2020. Maggie has had a bad past - a group of street dog haters apparently wanted bad for her, she was even hit by the same several times. She has been a victim of cruelty. She cannot now use her hind leg and limps since then. Due to her age and health complications she remained with MGC. She is now a very happy senior, loves caretakes.</p>

        <p>Through passive adoption, you can sponsor the meals & basic needs of the animal on a monthly basis without taking them home. We look after them, provide medical care & grooming while they continue to live at our centre. Your sponsorship enables us to focus our resources on maintaining & upgrading our infrastructure & veterinary care facilities. You can visit your adoptee as often as youâ€™d like & ensure they live the rest of their days with security, stability & love.</p>
