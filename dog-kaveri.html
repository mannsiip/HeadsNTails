        <p>Meet Kaveri, a sweet soul with a heart full of love and a tail that wags with the rhythm of joy. At the tender age of 13, Kaveri is not just a dog; she's a testament to a lifetime of loyalty, warmth, and unwavering companionship.</p>

        <p>Picture this: a wise face adorned with a touch of gray, eyes that gleam with the wisdom of countless adventures, and a spirit that's as lively as the day she first entered our lives. She has gracefully weathered the seasons, embracing every moment with a grace that only comes with age. Kaveri is a living example that love knows no bounds and that a senior dog can bring immeasurable joy to any home.</p>

        <p>Imagine the joy of having a seasoned companion by your side, sharing the warmth of your home, and being a constant reminder of the beauty in simple, everyday moments. Kaveri is open to being adopted into a comforting home, but would also appreciate being passively adopted until she finds a home.</p>

        <p>Through passive adoption, you can sponsor the meals & basic needs of the animal on a monthly basis without taking them home. We look after them, provide medical care & grooming while they continue to live at our centre. Your sponsorship enables us to focus our resources on maintaining & upgrading our infrastructure & veterinary care facilities. You can visit your adoptee as often as youâ€™d like & ensure they live the rest of their days with security, stability & love.</p>
