🐾 Heads N Tails Animal Shelter – Web Application
📘 Project Overview
This repository contains the complete source code for the Heads N Tails Animal Shelter website — a nonprofit initiative founded in 2020 to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome injured, sick, and abandoned animals. The website acts as a digital platform for public engagement and operational transparency, built using a modular and responsive frontend architecture.

It provides multiple user interaction points, including passive and active adoption, monetary and in-kind donations, contact forms, and an FAQ knowledge base.
