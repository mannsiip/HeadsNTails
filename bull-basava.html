        <p>Basava was brought into Heads N Tails in November 2021 and has been a permanenet resident ever since! He is gentle but may playfully nudge you on the back with his horns when one isn’t alert! You can passively adopt Basava to give him a secure, stable life filled with love & care.</p>

        <p>Through passive adoption, you can sponsor the meals & basic needs of the animal on a monthly basis without taking them home. We look after them, provide medical care & grooming while they continue to live at our centre. Your sponsorship enables us to focus our resources on maintaining & upgrading our infrastructure & veterinary care facilities. You can visit your adoptee as often as you’d like & ensure they live the rest of their days with security, stability & love.</p>
