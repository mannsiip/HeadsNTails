        <p>In the twilight of her life, Gulabi, a beautiful purebred German Shepherd, finds herself alone and abandoned. At 11+ years old, she should be basking in the warmth of a loving home, but he has found a halfway home in our Geriatric Center. Help us by passively adopting her!</p>

        <p>Gulabi's journey has been marked by loyalty and love, traits inherent to her breed. Yet, somewhere along the way, she was forsaken, left to navigate the challenges of aging on her own. Despite facing joint and skin issues, Gulabi's spirit remains unbroken, and her heart still overflows with affection.Her eyes, though clouded by the passage of time, still reflect the innocent hope that comes with the promise of a second chance.</p>

        <p>We cannot fathom why someone would leave Gulabi behind. Her sweetness, friendliness, and docility are unmistakable, leaving us puzzled as to why she found herself on the cold streets outside HEADS & TAILS. Despite the unanswered questions, Gulabi bears no grudges and harbors no resentment. She simply longs for a warm bed, a caring touch, and a place to call home.<BR>AT MGC, she has found one.Consider being the hero Gulabi deserves. Reach out to HEADS & TAILS and become her passive adopter! Let her become the missing piece in your life.
